# HNO₃ Concentration Calculator

A simple web app to calculate the concentration (%) of nitric acid (HNO₃) from **temperature (°C)** and **density (kg/L)**.

The app is based on Perry/HandyMath data tables and uses:
- **Interpolation in temperature (T)**
- **Inversion in concentration (C)** via nearest-neighbor interpolation

## Features
- 📱 Mobile-friendly design (tested on iPhone 15 Pro)
- 🌙 Automatic **dark mode** (follows system settings)
- 🌐 Works directly in the browser (no installation required)
- 🏠 Can be saved to iPhone home screen and used like an app
- ✔️ Rounds concentration to **1 decimal**

## Usage
1. Enter **Temperature (°C)**  
2. Enter **Density (kg/L)** (comma or dot accepted)  
3. Tap **Calculate**  
4. The concentration (%) and status will be displayed
